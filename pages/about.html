                    <p>Hi, I’m Himanshu Goyal. I am a Dual Degree student at <a href="https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar</a>
                        in the School of Electrical Sciences, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. 
                        I work closely with <a href="https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/profile-print.php?furl=sudipta">Prof. Sudipta Saha</a> on practical and
                        scalability aspects of having Byzantine consensus in low power wireless systems. 
                        Along with this, I am also working on security &amp; privacy aspects for large scale decentralised systems.
                        Here, I am focussing on developing privacy-preserving solutions for efficient distributive computation.
                        I am also closely associated with <a href="https://sites.google.com/iitbbs.ac.in/dssrg">Decentralized and Smart Systems Research Group (DSSRG)</a>
                        at IIT Bhubaneswar.</p>
                
                    <!-- I graduated with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in) in 2018. I was a part of the [CSALT](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/csalt/) group and was advised by [Prof. Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/), working on problems in language modeling and sentiment classification. -->
                    
                    <p>I’ve spent some excellent summers in both industry and academia via internships. 
                        In Summer 2020, I interned with Embedded Systems and Robotics group team at TCS Research &amp; 
                        Innovation with <a href="http://www.chayansarkar.com/">Chayan Sarkar</a> on building customized language model
                         for cognitive robotics application. 
                          I also had a short stint working with <a href="https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arpita/">Arpita Patra</a> at 
                          <a href="https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~cris/about.html">Cryptography and Information Security lab</a>, IISc Bangalore in 2020.
                           In Summer 2019 I worked on workload characterization in Multi-tier Cloud Infrastructure 
                           at <a href="https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/">CNeRG - Complex Networks Research Lab</a>, IIT Kharagpur under the mentorship 
                           of <a href="http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sandipc/">Sandip Chakraborty</a>.
                    <!-- In Summer 2017, I worked on end-to-end speech recognition at [TTIC](http://ttic.edu/), a computer science research institute at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) campus, where I was lucky to have the joint advice of professors [Karen Livescu](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~klivescu), [Liang Lu](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~llu/) and [Kevin Gimpel](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~kgimpel/). Finally in Summer 2016, I contributed to [Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla)'s Automation Team via [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and [Quarter of Contribution](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution). --></p>
                    
                    <p>When I’m not working, I am generally lurking reddit and twitter for keeping myself updated about the recent trends in my research work. I would highly recommend to follow known researchers of your field for getting fast access to latest research directions. I like to collect resources for the benefit of fledgling students under 
                    <a href="crypt.html">Crypto Resources</a> and <a href="misc.html">Miscellaneous</a> section. The resources may range from basic to advanced level. 
                    I also maintain a <a href="blog.html">blog</a> which sporadically gets updated.</p>
                    
                    <p>During my undergraduate days, I was associated with <a href="http://www.e-summit-iitbbs.com/">E-Summit</a>, where I both 
                        participated and organised several events related to Entrepreneurship. 
                        I was also member of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/The-Fourth-WallDramatics-Society-of-IIT-Bhubaneswar-131402333580109">
                            The Fourth Wall</a>(Dramatics Society of IIT Bhubaneswar), 
                            where I took part in several open and stage acts. I completely enjoyed being here, I am and will cherish it throughout my life.</p>
