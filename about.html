                    Hi, I’m Himanshu Goyal. I am a Dual Degree student at <a href="https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar</a>
                    in the School of Electrical Sciences, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. 
                    I work closely with <a href="https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/profile-print.php?furl=sudipta">Prof. Sudipta Saha</a> on practical and
                    scalability aspects of having Byzantine consensus in low power wireless systems. 
                    Along with this, I am also working on security &amp; privacy aspects for large scale decentralised systems.
                    Here, I am focussing on developing privacy-preserving solutions for efficient distributive computation.
                    I am also closely associated with <a href="https://sites.google.com/iitbbs.ac.in/dssrg">Decentralized and Smart Systems Research Group (DSSRG)</a>
                    at IIT Bhubaneswar.

                    I’ve spent some excellent summers in both industry and academia via internships. 
                        In Summer 2020, I interned with Embedded Systems and Robotics group team at TCS Research &amp; 
                        Innovation with <a href="http://www.chayansarkar.com/">Chayan Sarkar</a> on building customized language model
                         for cognitive robotics application. 
                          I also had a short stint working with <a href="https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arpita/">Arpita Patra</a> at 
                          <a href="https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~cris/about.html">Cryptography and Information Security lab</a>, IISc Bangalore in 2020.
                           In Summer 2019 I worked on workload characterization in Multi-tier Cloud Infrastructure 
                           at <a href="https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/">CNeRG - Complex Networks Research Lab</a>, IIT Kharagpur under the mentorship 
                           of <a href="http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sandipc/">Sandip Chakraborty</a>.

                    When I’m not working, I am generally lurking reddit and twitter for keeping myself updated about the recent trends in my research work. I would highly recommend to follow known researchers of your field for getting fast access to latest research directions. I like to collect resources for the benefit of fledgling students under 
                    <a href="crypt.html">Crypto Resources</a> and <a href="misc.html">Miscellaneous</a> section. The resources may range from basic to advanced level. 
                    I also maintain a <a href="blog.html">blog</a> which sporadically gets updated.

                    During my undergraduate days, I was associated with <a href="http://www.e-summit-iitbbs.com/">E-Summit</a>, where I both 
                        participated and organised several events related to Entrepreneurship. 
                        I was also member of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/The-Fourth-WallDramatics-Society-of-IIT-Bhubaneswar-131402333580109">
                            The Fourth Wall</a>(Dramatics Society of IIT Bhubaneswar), 
                            where I took part in several open and stage acts. I completely enjoyed being here, I am and will cherish it throughout my life.
