I"B<p>I’ve been absolutely obsessed with Star Wars this week, especially Darth Vader. I’ve named my <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla_ci_tools/pull/469">Pull Request</a> after him, the video chat room with <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/armenzg/">Armen</a> and I’m thinking of changing my IRC nickname for a day! It’s probably because I just saw the awesome seventh movie in the series!</p>

<p>In any case, let’s get back to how the week worked for me.</p>

<h2 id="my-development-server">My Development Server!</h2>

<p>So I’ve officially given up on trying to set up the VPN for my loaner machine like I’d mentioned in the previous blog post. Luckily, <a href="https://github.com/djmitche">Dustin</a> has given me an awesome new server to work with. It did take some time to setup, since we want to shut the server down (using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo halt</code>) when the server won’t be used for prolonged periods. Dustin has a project to help turning on this server once again which can be found <a href="https://github.com/djmitche/proj">here</a>. I’ve set up this server with the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla_ci_tools">mozilla_ci_tools</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/pulse_actions">pulse_actions</a> repositories and they work like a charm, overcoming the restrictions I was facing from my institute!</p>

<h2 id="pulse-actions">Pulse Actions</h2>

<p>I’ve started work on <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/pulse_actions">Pulse Actions</a> on a bug to listen and identify <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile-guided_optimization">PGO</a> builds on <a href="https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-inbound">mozilla-inbound</a> or <a href="https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=fx-team">fx-team</a> and trigger all Talos jobs for these builds twice. More details can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/pulse_actions/issues/70">bug</a>.</p>

<p>My work on this can be found <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/pulse_actions/pull/73">here</a>. Working on this has been interesting so far. I’ve learnt the basic workflow followed by Pulse Actions, and I discovered two bugs in MozCI in this process. I spent most of this week fixing these two MozCI bugs and now I’m ready to carry on with the Pulse Actions bug.</p>

<h2 id="mozci-tools">MozCI Tools</h2>

<p>I did a lot of work for <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla_ci_tools">MozCI Tools</a> this week. I did two major additions. The <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla_ci_tools/pull/469">first</a> adds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile-guided_optimization">PGO</a> build type support and testing to MozCI Tools. The <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla_ci_tools/pull/470">second</a> adds a function to identify and trigger all talos jobs corresponding to a build (which I need for Pulse Actions).</p>

<p>While working on MozCI I really liked <a href="https://pytest.org">pytest</a> over Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/unittest.html">unittests</a>, and I hope to write a small tutorial on it soon!</p>

<h2 id="work-on-mozilla-central">Work on mozilla-central</h2>

<p>I’ve kicked off my GSoC project via <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1232005">Bug 1232005</a>. This fix now produces a <a href="https://queue.taskcluster.net/v1/task/LuVD5MjBRKyQVymZ11SlEw/runs/0/artifacts/public%2Fall_tasks.json">JSON file</a> containing all possible TaskCluster tasks that <strong>could</strong> have been produced. I now plan to read this file in Treeherder next week.</p>

<h2 id="coming-up">Coming up!</h2>

<p>I plan to read the <a href="https://treeherder.readthedocs.io/">Treeherder docs</a> this week and try to understand the workflow of the Django APIs. I do hope to fetch the JSON file I’ve produced in Treeherder and begin to parse it on the command of the <a href="https://treeherder.mozilla.org/docs/#!/project/Runnable_Jobs_list">runnable_jobs</a> API. I also hope to complete the Pulse Actions bug. I will try to write a short tutorial on this blog next week!</p>

<p>In other news, I’m travelling on 8th May to New Delhi for the <a href="http://cargillglobalscholars.com">Cargill Scholarship</a> interview. I do hope to do good job!</p>
