I"Ü<p>Itâ€™s summertime and I think I am back to writing blogs after a long drought. In my blogpost about <a href="/2016/12/31/wncc-wiki-launched.html">Grundy</a> I mentioned work on four projects, the first two being <a href="/2016/12/22/zero-to-established.html">StackOverflow Contribution</a> and <a href="/2016/12/31/wncc-wiki-launched.html">Grundy</a>. My third project was a <em>fitness</em> project, a personal challenge which I started in the end of September, 2016.</p>
