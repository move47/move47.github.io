I"©<p>The third and final part of the assignment, and guess what! We finally have our movie ready! You can catch a glimpse here - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfe_fRxyp5E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfe_fRxyp5E</a>.</p>

<p>This part of the assignment hasnâ€™t had major visual additions, but significant new features like playback and keyframes. I will go about to describe the major new changes.</p>

<h2 id="keyframes">Keyframes</h2>

<p>There is now a facility to save the state of the model at any point. This is written to a file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">keyframes.txt</code>, which is interally a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Keyframe</code> object. Every time this file write happens, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vector&lt;Keyframe&gt;</code> is updated which is a part of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Animate</code> class.</p>

<p>There is also a facility to clear the file and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vector</code>.</p>

<h2 id="playback--interpolation">Playback &amp; Interpolation</h2>

<p>Whenever the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">playback()</code> function is executed, a function of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Animate</code> class, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">play_next()</code> is called which generates the next frame in the scene. There is a linear interpolation between successive keyframes depending on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FPS</code> global variable.</p>

<p>After building the scene, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">glutPostRedisplay()</code> is called. There is a check, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">carry_on</code>, which checks whether any more keyframes are left to be rendered. This information is provided by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Animate</code> class.
If yes, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">glutTimerFunc()</code> is called to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">play_back()</code>, which executes after <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1 / FPS</code> seconds.</p>

<h2 id="movie">Movie</h2>

<p>To make the final movie, there is an option to export each frame to an external <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.tga</code> file. These files are then converted to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.png</code> files which are finally stitched together using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ffmpeg</code>.</p>

<h2 id="after-thoughts">After Thoughts</h2>

<p>The graphics project and course has been great to say the least! Iâ€™m really looking forward to studying Advanced Computer Graphics / Digital Geometry Processing in the future. I can finally say I know a bit about what goes into making those awesome video games.</p>
