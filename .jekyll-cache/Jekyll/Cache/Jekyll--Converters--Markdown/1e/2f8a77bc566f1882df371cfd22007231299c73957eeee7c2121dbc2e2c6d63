<p><em>Arthur Samuel</em>, a pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence, described <strong>machine learning</strong>
as a <em>field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed</em>. ML is being
increasingly utilized for a variety of applications from recommending new movies to programming self-driving
cars. Furthermore, owing to it’s breakthrough in computer vision, speech recognition, ads, social feed and
auto-complete etc, Deep Learning (DL) has gained huge attention and has helped the human race in many re-
spects. With the advancement in technology, we can extend the embedment of these sophisticated applications
into mobile devices and computers, with which individuals spend most of their time. Our activities like search
queries, purchase transactions, the videos we watch, and our movie preferences are the few types of information
that are being collected and stored on regular basis at both local(search engine) and remote storage(service
enabled servers) for further processing. <strong><em>Our personal data generated through these activities are used by ML
applications to give us better user-experience.</em></strong> Such private data is uploaded to centralized locations in clear
text for ML algorithms which in-turn extract patterns from them, and update models accordingly(<strong>federated
learning</strong>). The sensitivity of such data increases it’s risk of being maliciously used by an insider as well as
outsider. Additionally, it is possible to gain insights into private data sets even if these data are anonymized
and the ML models are inaccessible.
A machine learning process consists of two phases viz. <em>training phase</em> and <em>evaluation phase</em>. In the learn-
ing phase, a model or classifier is built on a possibly large data set. In the second phase, the trained model
is being queried and based on its result, it is further updated for better accuracy in the next time-step. For
every ML task, three different roles are possible: the input party (data owners or contributors), the computation
party and the result party. In such systems, the data owner(s) send their data to the computation party which
perform the required ML task and deliver the output to the result party. Such output could be an ML model
that the result party can utilize for testing new samples. In other cases, the computation party might keep the
ML model, and perform the task of testing new samples submitted by the result party, and returning the test
results to the result party. If all the three roles are played by the same entity, then privacy is naturally pre-
served, however when these roles are distributed across two or more entities, then <strong>PRIVACY-ENHANCING
TECHNOLOGIES</strong> are needed.</p>
