I"£<p>It truly was one mindblowing week! Right from midnight sightseeing walks, to meeting all the people in Mozilla Iâ€™ve ever worked with, to insights on how Mozilla functions and the exciting upcoming technologies, Iâ€™ll never forget this one week. Iâ€™ve uploaded all the photographs on <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5Y_SiDYwIObWU9GMHVXc0tjU1k">Google Drive</a>. Interested people are free to see!</p>
