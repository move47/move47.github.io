<p>My name is <strong>Himanshu Goyal</strong> (<a href="./assets/name.mp3"><span style="color:red">How to pronounce my name</span></a>). I am a Dual Degree Student at <a href="https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar</a> majoring in Computer Science. Currently, I am focussing on building large scale decentralized IoT/WSNs systems which embodies Trust, Security and Privacy guarantees. I am being advised by <a href="https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/profile-print.php?furl=sudipt">Dr. Sudipta Saha</a>. I am also closely associated with <a href="https://sites.google.com/iitbbs.ac.in/dssrg">Decentralized and Smart Systems Research Group (DSSRG)</a> at IIT Bhubaneswar.</p>

<p><!-- In the past, I've spent some excellent summers at [TCS Research and Innovation](https://www.tcs.com/research-and-innovation) (Summer 2020), and  at [CNERG IIT Kharagpur](https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/) (Summer 2019). --></p>

<p>I have worked on several disciplines ranging from Deep learning, Systems &amp; Networking, Blockchain, Trustworthy distributed computing and Privacy Preserving Machine Learning(PPML).</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I maintain a list of cryptographic resources under the <a href="https://move47.github.io/crypto_resources">Crypto Resources</a> tab. It mostly contains references to the courses taught at universities along with some additional useful information. <em>If you feel to contribute, I welcome you to contact me for the same.</em> 
I also occasionally <a href="https://move47.github.io/archive">blog</a> to distill out my understanding from the readings I do. 
Well, you can find me reading, lurking reddit and twitter in my spare time. Nevertheless, I am an ardent Cricket fan and love talking about it.</p>
