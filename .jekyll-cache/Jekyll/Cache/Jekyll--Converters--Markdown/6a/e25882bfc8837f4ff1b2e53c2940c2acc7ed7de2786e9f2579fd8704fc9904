<p>My name is <strong>Himanshu Goyal</strong> (<a href="./assets/name.mp3"><span style="color:red">How to pronounce my name</span></a>), and I am a fourth year Dual Degree Student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar</a>. Currently, I am focussing on to bring trust, security and privacy guarantees in large scale decentralized IoT Systems. I am being advised by <a href="https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/profile-print.php?furl=sudipt">Dr. Sudipta Saha</a>. I am also closely associated with <a href="https://sites.google.com/iitbbs.ac.in/dssrg">Decentralized and Smart Systems Research Group (DSSRG)</a> at IIT Bhubaneswar.</p>

<p>In the past, Iâ€™ve spent some excellent summers at <a href="https://www.tcs.com/research-and-innovation">TCS Research and Innovation</a> (Summer 2020), and  at <a href="https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/">CNERG IIT Kharagpur</a> (Summer 2019).</p>

<p>I have worked on several disciplines ranging from Deep learning, Systems &amp; Networking, Blockchain, Trustworthy distributed computing and Privacy Preserving Machine Learning(PPML). Well, I enjoy applied cryptography in particular.</p>

<p>I maintain a list of cryptographic resources under the <a href="https://martiansideofthemoon.github.io/crypto_resources">Resources</a> tab. I also <a href="https://martiansideofthemoon.github.io/archive">blog</a> every now and then compiling my personal experiences.</p>

<p>Verily, you can find me reading, lurking reddit and twitter in my spare time. Nevertheless, I am big Cricket fan and love talking about it.</p>
