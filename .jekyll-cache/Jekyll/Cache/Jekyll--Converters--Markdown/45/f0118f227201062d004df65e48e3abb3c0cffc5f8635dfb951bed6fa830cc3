I"~<p>A disappointing week, but that‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôd raised my expectations too much. There have been several weird merge conflicts on the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev">mozilla-central</a> which have delayed Dustin and my development process.
Thankfully, we saw a merge on Friday. Dustin has filed these anomalies in this in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1285259">Bug 1285259</a>.</p>

<p>The most pleasant thing this week was a wonderful story book I‚Äôve been reading, the first song of Ice and Fire, Game of Thrones!</p>

<h2 id="treeherder">Treeherder</h2>

<p>Lots of activity here! We merged the follow up <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/treeherder/pull/1633">Pull Request</a> improving the code used to schedule TaskCluster jobs. I did some other unrelated work for Treeherder in my spare time.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/treeherder/pull/1645">PR #1645</a> - A feature to improve the ‚ÄúCancel All Jobs‚Äù UI. This improved the tooltips and added an important use-case. The button doesn‚Äôt strictly ‚ÄúCancel All Jobs‚Äù now!</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/treeherder/pull/1646">PR #1646</a> - My first Perfherder fix! This fix adds an option for any viewer to copy alert summary to his clipboard. Boy, adding stuff to the clipboard is harder than I thought!</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/treeherder/pull/1661">PR #1661</a> (Open) - This is a feature to improve to eliminate a very irritating issue in the Sherrif panel of Treeherder. I doubt this is going to be an easy fix though!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mozci--pulse-actions">MozCI / Pulse Actions</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla_ci_tools/pull/489">PR</a> to schedule Action Tasks has been merged! I did a short <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla_ci_tools/pull/491">refactoring</a> to help the pulse_actions PR. We should be merging that on Monday. All in all, the work in these two repositories seems to be getting over.</p>

<h2 id="taskcluster">TaskCluster</h2>

<p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1284005">Bug 1284005</a> has been a major source of irritation this week. It was stuck in a merge conflict and took nearly the entire week to get merged.</p>

<p>Another feature I have been desperately waiting for is module finder which Dustin‚Äôs working on in this <a href="https://reviewboard.mozilla.org/r/61882/diff/2#index_header">revision</a>. Again, this was backed out due to a weird merge conflict and it hasn‚Äôt landed yet! Action Tasks need this to function.</p>

<p>The Action Task work in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1281062">Bug 1281062</a> has been split up into two patches, with the second patch adding all the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">from_json</code> code for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TaskGraph</code>. I‚Äôve filed that in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1285755">Bug 1285755</a>. This code is more or less ready, and should be good to go this week.</p>

<p>I had a hard time with Mercurial while splitting up the patches. I really need to start using Mercurial bookmarks.</p>

<h2 id="bugzilla">Bugzilla</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve been exploring the Bugzilla code in Perl with Dylan and I‚Äôve gotten my first bug to solve! This patch hopes to speed up things a certain ‚ÄúEnter Bug‚Äù page (for Firefox Core bugs). It‚Äôs tracked in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021795">1021795</a>.</p>

<h2 id="other-news">Other News</h2>

<p>Well nothing here this week. I just hope France win the Euro 2016 final!</p>

<h2 id="coming-up">Coming Up</h2>

<p>Code Reviews, those <strong>r+</strong> I‚Äôve been desperately waiting for, some testing and QA (hopefully) and yes, a fifth semester of Electrical Engineering!</p>
