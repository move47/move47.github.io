I"g<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Himanshu Goyal. I am a Dual Degree student at <a href="https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar</a> in the School of Electrical Sciences, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I work closely with <a href="https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/profile-print.php?furl=sudipta">Prof. Sudipta Saha</a> on practical and scalability aspects of having Byzantine consensus in low power wireless systems. Along with this, I am also working on security &amp; privacy aspects for large scale decentralised systems. Here, I am focussing on developing privacy-preserving solutions for efficient distributive computation. I am also closely associated with <a href="https://sites.google.com/iitbbs.ac.in/dssrg">Decentralized and Smart Systems Research Group (DSSRG)</a> at IIT Bhubaneswar.</p>

<!-- I graduated with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in) in 2018. I was a part of the [CSALT](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/csalt/) group and was advised by [Prof. Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/), working on problems in language modeling and sentiment classification. -->

<p>Iâ€™ve spent some excellent summers in both industry and academia via internships. In Summer 2020, I interned with Embedded Systems and Robotics group team at TCS Research &amp; Innovation with <a href="http://www.chayansarkar.com/">Chayan Sarkar</a> on building customized language model for cognitive robotics application.  I also had a short stint working with <a href="https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arpita/">Arpita Patra</a> at <a href="https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~cris/about.html">Cryptography and Information Security lab</a>, IISc Bangalore in 2020. In Summer 2019 I worked on workload characterization in Multi-tier Cloud Infrastructure at <a href="https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/">CNeRG - Complex Networks Research Lab</a>, IIT Kharagpur under the mentorship of <a href="http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sandipc/">Sandip Chakraborty</a>.
<!-- In Summer 2017, I worked on end-to-end speech recognition at [TTIC](http://ttic.edu/), a computer science research institute at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) campus, where I was lucky to have the joint advice of professors [Karen Livescu](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~klivescu), [Liang Lu](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~llu/) and [Kevin Gimpel](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~kgimpel/). Finally in Summer 2016, I contributed to [Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla)'s Automation Team via [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and [Quarter of Contribution](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution). --></p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not working, I am generally lurking reddit and twitter for keeping myself updated about the recent trends in my research work. I would highly recommend to follow known researchers of your field for getting fast access to latest research directions. I like to collect resources for the benefit of fledgling students under 
<a href="https://move47.github.io/crypto_resources/">Crypto Resources</a> <a href="https://move47.github.io//Miscellaneous/">Miscellaneous</a>and have written a few articles compiling my experiences with graduate school admissions, visa applications, biking etc. During my undergraduate days, I used to lead a club at IIT Bombay, namely <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wncc.iitb/">The Web and Coding Club</a>, where we help people get started with code. I also used to actively contribute to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/5080995/martianwars">StackOverflow</a> and to our clubâ€™s <a href="http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki">wiki</a>, a beginnerâ€™s programming guide. Finally, I <a href="https://move47.github.io/assets/rubik.jpg">collect</a> Rubiks puzzles! Unfortunately, I am not good at solving them!</p>

<p>Some people on the internet (especially on Mozillaâ€™s IRC) know me as <em>martianwars</em>.</p>
