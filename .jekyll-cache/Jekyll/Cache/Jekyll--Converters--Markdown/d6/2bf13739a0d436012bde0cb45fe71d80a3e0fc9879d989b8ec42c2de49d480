I"”<p>After a monthâ€™s work, Iâ€™ve finally received my J1 visa and Iâ€™m ready to visit <a href="http://www.ttic.edu/">TTIC</a> at the University of Chicago campus. In this blog Iâ€™ll try to collect a few resources that helped me through the application process, along with my experience. Unfortunately, a number of seemingly disconnected steps need to be completed to have a successful application.</p>
