I"Q<p>It’s been a fun week and I’m really enjoying myself this GSoC. Quite a productive one, and I discovered an excellent new sport, cycling!</p>

<p>I’ve always loved the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon">Pokémon</a> video games and my recent completion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_HeartGold_and_SoulSilver">HeartGold</a> brought back these fond memories. I dedicate this week’s theme to Pokémon, with my two favourite starter Pokémon engaged in a fierce battle!</p>

<p>Here are the technical details for the week :-</p>

<h2 id="treeherder">Treeherder</h2>

<p>I’ve finally gotten around the huge codebase of Treeherder and have successfully managed to produce the URL to <a href="https://public-artifacts.taskcluster.net/Zo4UsXv_QH2VdJhSODwwWQ/0/public/all_tasks.json">all_tasks.json</a>. I’m sending this URL to the Treeherder backend which downloads the file using <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/">requests</a> and parses it to get it in the Treeherder data structure. Treeherder has a wonderful database which gets all the extra information I need.
I send this data back and lo and behold, we have TaskCluster jobs in Treeherder!
(All the code is in this <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/treeherder/pull/1490">Pull Request</a>).</p>

<p>Original Set of Jobs :-

<p>“Add New Jobs” (TaskCluster only) :-

<h2 id="mozci-tools">MozCI Tools</h2>

<p>I set out to refactor <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla_ci_tools/blob/9f14aebcf3255a12114076098ef6ce8b0ed5ea8d/test/test_platforms.py">test_platforms.py</a> by removing the irritating mock_allthethings.json file. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla_ci_tools/pull/475">Pull Request</a>.</p>

<p>It was a fun fix, I learnt a lot about the different tools in <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla_ci_tools/blob/9f14aebcf3255a12114076098ef6ce8b0ed5ea8d/mozci/platforms.py">platforms.py</a>. I now download a version of allthethings.json in the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla_ci_tools/blob/735f5a4ffd38f6dccb40727d7985b9f8bd23e7f0/tox.ini">tox file</a> and use it for all testing purposes. Tests are a bit slower now, but more efficient nevertheless. This fix also increased the test coverage of the MozCI project.</p>

<h2 id="pulse-actions">Pulse Actions</h2>

<p>Since my last feature to duplicate talos jobs on PGO builds, we added a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/pulse_actions/pull/80">small change</a>. This disables this feature on Windows 8 builds. The following picture will give you a better idea.</p>

<p><img src="https://move47.github.io/assets/talos2.png" alt="talos_no_win8" /></p>

<p>Like you can see, for the Windows XP PGO build, our feature is still working, but it’s been disabled for Windows 8 PGO build.</p>

<h2 id="web-platform-tests-viewer">Web Platform Tests Viewer</h2>

<p>Unrelated to GSoC, but I’m back to developing my Mozilla Quarter of Contribution Project, <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/wptview">wptview</a>. A few awesome contributors have agreed to refactor wptview as a part of their QoC, this summer. We have made some excellent progress over the last one week, including a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/wptview/commit/b2ddf8f296e376cf0da7e0e7a81d5a857fa64ec0">feature to edit run names</a>, an important <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/wptview/commit/6f069c0612be7e2aec82bb9c997a121ee3a73ca7">bug fix</a> in the SQL queries, and some checks on the Import Button, a major one <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/wptview/commit/d6fbbfe5e8686583c2449aae92f8ff30f54bb57d">here</a>.</p>

<p>I’m excited to mentor this Quarter of Contribution. You can find out more about this project <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution/WPTViewer_Refactor">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="other-news">Other News</h2>

<p>I’ve started cycling longer distances and I’m keeping track of these workouts on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fitnesskeeper.runkeeper.pro&amp;hl=en">Runkeeper</a>. I hope to make this an habit as I buy a new cycle next week.</p>

<h2 id="coming-up">Coming up!</h2>

<p>A lot of changes have regressed a few tests in MozCI and I hope to work on fixing some of these failing tests. I also hope to increase the code coverage of the MozCI tests. Lastly, I hope to finish the second part of the Treeherder integration.</p>
