I"²<p>A disappointing week, but thatâ€™s probably because Iâ€™d raised my expectations too much. There have been several weird merge conflicts on the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev">mozilla-central</a> which have delayed Dustin and my development process.
Thankfully, we saw a merge on Friday. Dustin has filed these anomalies in this in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1285259">Bug 1285259</a>.</p>
