I"ä<p>I recently used crowdsourced experiments for the first time during my Bachelorâ€™s Thesis Project with <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/">Prof. Preethi Jyothi</a>. In this blog I will share a few important steps we took to improve the quality of our crowdsourced data. I sincerely thank <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/">Prof. Mohit Iyyer</a> for suggesting several useful tips during these experiments, many of which will appear throughout this blog.</p>
