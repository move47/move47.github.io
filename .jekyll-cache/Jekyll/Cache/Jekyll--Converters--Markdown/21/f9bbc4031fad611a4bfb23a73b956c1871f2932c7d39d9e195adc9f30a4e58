I",<p>It’s been a week at Chicago and I’m having a really unique experience here. As I mentioned in my <a href="/2017/05/17/applying-for-j1.html">previous post</a>, I have been selected as a visiting researcher at the <a href="http://ttic.edu">Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago</a>, a CS research institute located on the <a href="http://uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a> campus. Life is so different here, in both good and bad ways. I will be in Chicago for seven more weeks, working on encoders for automatic speech recognition tasks.</p>
