I"<p>Previously, I wrote an <a href="/2017/12/08/gre-toefl-preparation.html">article</a> on GRE and TOEFL preparation. This is my second blogpost on graduate school admissions. I have tried to compile all the online resources I used to prepare my graduate school application.<br />
Most of this advice is <strong>written by professors</strong> and is focused towards PhD applicants. Several webpages shared in this blog contain a wide-spectrum of advice articles, many of which are relevant to undergraduates and graduate school applicants.</p>
