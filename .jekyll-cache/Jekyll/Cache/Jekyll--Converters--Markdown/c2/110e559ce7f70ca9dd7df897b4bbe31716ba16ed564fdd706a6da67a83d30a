I"-<p>All the code’s been merged and the feature works! Hurrah!</p>

<p>Of course, there are a few issues here and there which we will fix over the due time. This will be my last blog of the series. After this, I’ll have one blog having a list of all the work I did for GSoC. I’ll also make one more blogpost where I introduce this wonderful new feature.</p>

<p>This week has been a fitness week, thanks to Pokemon Go! You just can’t stop walking :)</p>

<h2 id="taskcluster">TaskCluster</h2>

<p>This week we saw the successful merge of <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1285755">Bug 1285755</a> followed by <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1281062">Bug 1281062</a>. This was tested in four important use cases by us and Armen has documented it in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1284911">Bug 1284911</a>.</p>

<p>I have filed a follow up bug, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1286813">Bug 1286813</a>. This fix will provide additional optimizations when there are multiple Action Tasks.</p>

<h2 id="mozci--pulse-actions">MozCI / Pulse Actions</h2>

<p>All the MozCI / Pulse Actions work has been merged. TaskCluster has granted Pulse Actions additional scopes to allow it to schedule jobs to Treeherder’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">try</code> repository.</p>

<h2 id="treeherder">Treeherder</h2>

<p>A couple of commits were merged under <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1284911">Bug 1284911</a>. These commits activate new runnable TaskCluster jobs in the UI and fix a filtering issue in my main Treeherder patch. Once these were merged, the project was complete.</p>

<p>I’ve filed two follow up bugs. A good-first-bug for newcomers, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1286897">Bug 1286897</a> and another simple bug after Pulse Actions is granted more scopes, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1286894">Bug 1286894</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/treeherder/pull/1661">PR #1661</a> has made some substantial progress, and I’ve been successful in solving most of the issue and adding the corresponding unittest. However, we still have some performance concerns.</p>

<p>It might take a while before we can merge this Pull Request.</p>

<h2 id="bugzilla">Bugzilla</h2>

<p>I did some work for the Bugzilla issue in this <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-bteam/bmo/pull/14">Pull Request</a>. I need to continue this with a database call optimization.</p>

<p>Setting up Bugzilla has been a tough task to be honest!</p>

<h2 id="other-news">Other News</h2>

<p>College has started, and lots of new things to explore!</p>

<h2 id="coming-up">Coming Up</h2>

<p>Like I said this is my last blogpost in the weekly series. There will be two more blogs, one having a complete list of commits to Mozilla for GSoC, and the second introducing the feature for developers.</p>

<p>I do hope you found my weekly blog series interesting :)</p>
