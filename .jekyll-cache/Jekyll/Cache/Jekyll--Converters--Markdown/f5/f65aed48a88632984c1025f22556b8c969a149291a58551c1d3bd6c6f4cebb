I"D<p>I recently gave the GRE and TOEFL exams in preparation for MS / PhD applications. While there exist several excellent resources to help you prepare (<a href="https://magoosh.com/">Magoosh</a>, <a href="https://www.greenlighttestprep.com/">GreenlightTestPrep</a>, <a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/">Princeton Review</a>, <a href="https://www.manhattanprep.com/gre/">Manhattan</a>), I thought it would be useful to share my personal experience with both tests. I might write a blog on grad school admission in the future (of course, conditioned on the admits I get!)</p>
