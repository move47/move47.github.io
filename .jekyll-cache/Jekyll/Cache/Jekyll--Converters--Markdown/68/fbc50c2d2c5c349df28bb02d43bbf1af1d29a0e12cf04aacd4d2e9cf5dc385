<p><em>Arthur Samuel</em>, a pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence, described <strong>machine learning</strong>
as a <em>field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed</em>. ML is being
increasingly utilized for a variety of applications from recommending new movies to programming self-driving
cars. Furthermore, owing to it‚Äôs breakthrough in computer vision, speech recognition, ads, social feed and
auto-complete etc, Deep Learning (DL) has gained huge attention and has helped the human race in many re-
spects. With the advancement in technology, we can extend the embedment of these sophisticated applications
into mobile devices and computers, with which individuals spend most of their time. Our activities like search
queries, purchase transactions, the videos we watch, and our movie preferences are the few types of information
that are being collected and stored on regular basis at both local(search engine) and remote storage(service
enabled servers) for further processing. <strong><em>Our personal data generated through these activities are used by ML
applications to give us better user-experience.</em></strong> Such private data is uploaded to centralized locations in clear
text for ML algorithms which in-turn extract patterns from them, and update models accordingly(<strong>federated
learning</strong>). The sensitivity of such data increases it‚Äôs risk of being maliciously used by an insider as well as
outsider. Additionally, it is possible to gain insights into private data sets even if these data are anonymized
and the ML models are inaccessible.
A machine learning process consists of two phases viz. <em>training phase</em> and <em>evaluation phase</em>. In the learn-
ing phase, a model or classifier is built on a possibly large data set. In the second phase, the trained model
is being queried and based on its result, it is further updated for better accuracy in the next time-step. For
every ML task, three different roles are possible: the input party (data owners or contributors), the computation
party and the result party. In such systems, the data owner(s) send their data to the computation party which
perform the required ML task and deliver the output to the result party. Such output could be an ML model
that the result party can utilize for testing new samples. In other cases, the computation party might keep the
ML model, and perform the task of testing new samples submitted by the result party, and returning the test
results to the result party. If all the three roles are played by the same entity, then privacy is naturally pre-
served, however when these roles are distributed across two or more entities, then <strong>PRIVACY-ENHANCING
TECHNOLOGIES</strong> are needed.</p>

<p>2018 was a breakout year for privacy-preserving machine learning(PPML). This year‚Äôs news cycle had several
major stories surface around data privacy, which makes it the most relevant year for privacy since the Snowden
leaks in 2013. Data Privacy impacts our politics, security, businesses, relationships, health, and finances.</p>

<p>In this technology-driven world, most of the organizations have deployed
their ML and DL based trained models into the cloud for better reliability and integrity. For a particular query
from Data owners, they are both Computation Party and Results‚Äô Party and this can affect the overall privacy
of owners adversely. In fact, with all of the data that is collected from individuals around the world on daily
basis, data owners might not be aware of how the data collected from them is being used (or misused), and in
many cases, not even aware that some data types are being collected.</p>

<p>About 2 years ago, Google researchers introduced a Skin disease classifier at the global level. They developed
an application to take photos of skin, and run it to <strong>CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)</strong> to intimate about
your visit to a dermatologist. It was also observed that the accuracy of prediction was an expert level.</p>

When the user queries the application, the input skin image may contain noise incorporated by unknown sources
about which the user is entirely unaware. Under such circumstances, the results may steeply deviate and thus
become unreliable. Therefore, we need privacy at both the input and output ends when we don‚Äôt have access
to the model.</p>

<strong>Note:</strong> This is one of the example on top of my head now. There are hundreds of others also, which directs affects user privacy.</p>
<h3 id="standard-federated-training-algorithm--">Standard Federated Training Algorithm :-</h3>
<p><strong>Step I</strong>. The master device sends the current global model parameters to all worker devices.</p>

<p><strong>Step II</strong>. The worker devices update their local model parameters using the current global model parameters and their local training datasets in parallel. In particular, each worker device essentially aims to solve the loss function using the stochastic gradient descent. Note that a worker device could apply <strong><em>SGD</em></strong> multiple rounds to update its local model. After updating the local models, the worker devices send them to the master device.</p>

<p><strong>Step III</strong>. The master device aggregates the local models from the worker devices to obtain a new global model according to a certain aggregation rule. <em>REPEAT STEP I.</em></p>

<h2 id="some-literature-review-about-attacks-on-fl">Some literature review about attacks on FL</h2>
<p>If we see the federated training algorithm closely, in all the three steps, the data of each individual is not being used directly, which motivates the participating users to share their sensitive data for useful learning. At first glance, it also provides some privacy guarantee as the raw data never leaves the user device, and only updates to models (e.g., gradient updates) are sent to the central server, which is not in the case of a centralized setting. On the contrary,  recent works by <em>Shokri et al</em> <span style="color:green"><a href="#references">[4]</a></span> have shown that it is possible to construct scenarios in which information about the raw data is leaked from a client to the server, such as a scenario <em>where knowing the previous model and the gradient update from a user would allow one to infer a training example held by that user</em> which is popularly known as <strong><em>Membership-Inference attack</em></strong> among ML community.</p>

<p>To provide better user privacy, several cryptographic and data perturbation techniques like 
<em>Homomorphic Encryption, Secure-Multi Party Computation, and Differential Privacy</em>(or any combination of them) are proposed, which do provide a reliable theoretical privacy guarantee. <em>Bargav et al.</em> <span style="color:green"><a href="#references">[3]</a></span>  presented a better lower bound in Differential Privacy as compared to other state-of-art bounds by perturbing the gradient at MPC i.e., aggregation side instead of adding noise at user level for Logistic regression. However the work didn‚Äôt show any bounds for Deep learning algorithms which are mostly used in various learning tasks now-a-days. <em>Bargav et al.</em> <span style="color:green"><a href="#references">[2]</a></span> also shows the evaluation of the different versions of DP like <em>Naive DP, Renyi DP, etc.</em> on several well-known datasets trained using both traditional ML and Neural Networks algorithms and found out <em>privacy loss is directly proportional to number of epochs</em>. The <strong>Secure Aggregation protocol</strong> from <em>McMahan et al.</em> <span style="color:green"><a href="#references">[5]</a></span> has strong privacy guarantees when aggregating client updates. Moreover, the protocol is tailored to the setting of federated learning. For example,
it is robust to clients dropping out during the execution (a common feature of cross-device FL) and scales to
a large number of parties and vector lengths. However, this approach has several limitations: (a) it assumes a
semi-honest server (only in the private key infrastructure phase), (b) it allows the server to see the per-round
aggregates (which may still leak information), (c) it is not efficient for sparse vector aggregation, and (d)
it lacks the ability to enforce well-formedness of client inputs. Furthermore <span style="color:green"><a href="#references">[1]</a></span> , also provides the concept of FHE, which suits better in case of heavy computational edge devices, but fails miserably where end devices are Mobile phones or IOT devices, which of-course is the case of federated learning.</p>

<p>In the distributed datacenter and centralized settings, there has been a wide variety of work concerning
attacks and defenses for various <em>targetted</em> and <em>untargetted</em> attacks, namely through <strong>model update poisoning, data poisoning.</strong> for example, (an adversary might attempt to prevent a model from being learned at all). In these attacks, the adversary(or adversaries) directly control some number of clients, and thus, they can directly manipulate reports to service provider to alter the outputs to bias the learned model towards their objective. They may also be able to tailor their output to have similar variance and magnitude as the correct model updates, making them difficut to detect. For this, several <em>Byzantine-Resilient Defense</em> mechanisms were proposed by machine learning and Blockchain community, one of them is to replace the averaging step on the server with median-based agreegators. <em>Fang et al.</em> <span style="color:green"><a href="#references">[7]</a></span> performs successful local model poisoing attacks, which can substantially increase the error rates
of the models learnt through federated learning that
were claimed to be robust against Byzantine failures of some
client devices.</p>
<h3 id="relationship-between-model-update-poisoning-and-data-poisoning">Relationship between model update poisoning and data poisoning</h3>
<p>Intuitively, the relation between model update poisoning and data poisoning
should depend on the over-parameterization of the model with respect to the data. The study by <em>Fang et al.</em> <span style="color:green"><a href="#references">[6]</a></span> proposes two methods to defend against local model poisoning attacks. Their results clearly show that only in some cases, one out of two methods can effectively
defend these attacks and it also make the global model slower to learn
and adapt to new data as that data may be identified as from
potentially malicious local models. Thus, the proposed defenses are not effective enough for every case, highlighting the need for
new defenses against model poisoning attacks to
federated learning. Existing defenses against backdoor attacks either require a careful examination of the training data, or full control of the training process at the server (as happens in centralised setting), none of which may hold in the federated learning setting. <em>The property of Zero-knowledge proof can be used to ensure that users are submitting updates with pre-decided protocol</em>. One interesting line of study would be to quantify the gap between these two types of attacks, and relate
this gap to the relative strength of an adversary operating under these attack models. For example, the maximum number of clients that can
perform data poisoning attacks may be much higher than the number that can perform model update poisoning attacks, especially in cross-device settings. Thus, understanding the relation between these two attack
types, especially as they relate to the number of adversarial clients, would greatly help our understanding of
the threat landscape in federated learning.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-while-writing-this-post">Motivation while writing this post</h2>
<p>I had the following motivations while writing this post:-<br />
Given <strong><em>n</em></strong>, no. of working devices and an honest 
but curious Server, Formulation of an innovative protocol which can provide rigorous privacy guarantees in the following scenarios:-</p>
<ul>
  <li>When m out of n clients become adversaries or an adversary controls m clients in the cross-device or cross-silo federated setting, aiming to perform various attacks such as Data Poisoning, Model UpdatePoisoning, and Backdoor attacks.</li>
  <li>Robustness of the same developed protocol towards federated training algorithm, when a certain number of trusted users drop out due to participation constraints, ending up in a network having more number of malicious clients.</li>
</ul>
