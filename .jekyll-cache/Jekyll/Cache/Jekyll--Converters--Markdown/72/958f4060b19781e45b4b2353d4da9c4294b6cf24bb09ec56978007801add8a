I"Ú<p>A month has elapsed since I started my GSoC project. Itâ€™s been a great learning experience and Iâ€™ve learnt several aspects about Mozillaâ€™s Testing infrastructure.
This week I saw the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Angry_Birds_Movie">Angry Birds Movie</a>, and I canâ€™t seem to get Peter Dinklageâ€™s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxBsM1QOZbE">Mighty Eagle</a> song out of my head. So I had very little choice while I chose my theme.</p>
