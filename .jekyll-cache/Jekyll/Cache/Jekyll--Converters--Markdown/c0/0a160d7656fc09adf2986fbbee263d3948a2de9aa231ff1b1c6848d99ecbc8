I"7<p>I’ve generally been pretty skeptical about cycling outside the IIT campus in Mumbai. It’s slow and dangerous due to the reckless Mumbai traffic. I’d made a few midnight trips to other parts of Powai last year, but never ventured any further. Nevertheless, our group (including <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100006442563676">Abhin Shah</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/karanchadha005">Karan Chadha</a>, <a href="http://cheekujodhpur.github.io/">Kumar Ayush</a> and <a href="https://sandeshkalantre.github.io/">Sandesh Kalantre</a>) planned a 5:30AM cycling trip to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versova,_Mumbai#Versova_beach">Versova Beach</a> on Sunday, 3rd September. A 35KM round-trip, I was really looking forward to this after a two month break from cycling (in Chicago).</p>
