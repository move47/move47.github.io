I"¥<p>Itâ€™s been a really hectic week, and unfortunately I could not do too much GSoC work, but I guess Iâ€™m on track. At the end of this week, I gifted a friend my favourite fantasy story, <a href="http://www.alagaesia.com/books_detail.php?book=eragon">Eragon</a>, the first book of the Inheritance Cycle. With sweet memories, Iâ€™ll dedicate this weekâ€™s theme to Saphira, the main dragon in the Inheritance Cycle.</p>
