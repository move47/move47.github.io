I"<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Himanshu Goyal. I am a Dual Degree student at <a href="https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar</a> in the School of Electrical Sciences, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I work closely with <a href="https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/profile-print.php?furl=sudipta">Prof. Sudipta Saha</a> on practical and scalability aspects of having Byzantine consensus in low power wireless systems like IoT systems. Along with this, I am also working on security &amp; privacy aspects in IoT. Here, I am focussing on developing privacy-preserving solutions for distributive computation. I am also closely associated with <a href="https://sites.google.com/iitbbs.ac.in/dssrg">Decentralized and Smart Systems Research Group (DSSRG)</a> at IIT Bhubaneswar.</p>

<!-- I graduated with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in) in 2018. I was a part of the [CSALT](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/csalt/) group and was advised by [Prof. Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/), working on problems in language modeling and sentiment classification. -->

<p>Iâ€™ve spent some excellent summers in industry and academia via internships. In Summer 2020, I interned at the <a href="https://research.google/teams/brain">Google Brain</a> team with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/royaurko">Aurko Roy</a> working on retrieval augmented generation algorithms. In Summer 2019 I worked on model extraction attacks with the <a href="https://ai.google/research/teams/language/">Google AI Language</a> team in New York under the mentorship of <a href="https://ai.google/research/people/GauravSinghTomar/">Gaurav Singh Tomar</a> and <a href="https://ai.google/research/people/104995/">Ankur Parikh</a> and <a href="https://www.papernot.fr/">Nicolas Papernot</a>.
In Summer 2017, I worked on end-to-end speech recognition at <a href="http://ttic.edu/">TTIC</a>, a computer science research institute at <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/">The University of Chicago</a> campus, where I was lucky to have the joint advice of professors <a href="http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~klivescu">Karen Livescu</a>, <a href="http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~llu/">Liang Lu</a> and <a href="http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~kgimpel/">Kevin Gimpel</a>. Finally in Summer 2016, I contributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla">Mozilla</a>â€™s Automation Team via <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> and <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution">Quarter of Contribution</a>.</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not working, I am generally <a href="{ site.url }}/birding">birding</a>, hiking, biking reading or star gazing. I like to <a href="https://martiansideofthemoon.github.io/archive.html">blog</a> and have written a few articles compiling my experiences with graduate school admissions, visa applications, biking etc. During my undergraduate days, I used to lead a club at IIT Bombay, namely <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wncc.iitb/">The Web and Coding Club</a>, where we help people get started with code. I also used to actively contribute to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/5080995/martianwars">StackOverflow</a> and to our clubâ€™s <a href="http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki">wiki</a>, a beginnerâ€™s programming guide. Finally, I <a href="https://martiansideofthemoon.github.io/assets/rubik.jpg">collect</a> Rubiks puzzles! Unfortunately, I am not good at solving them!</p>

<p>Some people on the internet (especially on Mozillaâ€™s IRC) know me as <em>martianwars</em>.</p>
