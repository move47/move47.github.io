I"˜<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Himanshu Goyal. I am a Dual Degree student at <a href="https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar</a> in the School of Electrical Sciences, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I work closely with <a href="https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/profile-print.php?furl=sudipta">Prof. Sudipta Saha</a> on practical and scalability aspects of having Byzantine consensus in low power wireless systems. Along with this, I am also working on security &amp; privacy aspects for large scale decentralised systems. Here, I am focussing on developing privacy-preserving solutions for efficient distributive computation. I am also closely associated with <a href="https://sites.google.com/iitbbs.ac.in/dssrg">Decentralized and Smart Systems Research Group (DSSRG)</a> at IIT Bhubaneswar.</p>

<!-- I graduated with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in) in 2018. I was a part of the [CSALT](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/csalt/) group and was advised by [Prof. Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/), working on problems in language modeling and sentiment classification. -->

<p>Iâ€™ve spent some excellent summers in both industry and academia via internships. In Summer 2020, I interned with Embedded Systems and Robotics group team at TCS Research &amp; Innovation with <a href="http://www.chayansarkar.com/">Chayan Sarkar</a> on building customized language model for cognitive robotics application.  I also had a short stint working with <a href="https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arpita/">Arpita Patra</a> at <a href="https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~cris/about.html">Cryptography and Information Security lab</a>, IISc Bangalore in 2020. In Summer 2019 I worked on workload characterization in Multi-tier Cloud Infrastructure at <a href="https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/">CNeRG - Complex Networks Research Lab</a>, IIT Kharagpur under the mentorship of <a href="http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sandipc/">Sandip Chakraborty</a>.
<!-- In Summer 2017, I worked on end-to-end speech recognition at [TTIC](http://ttic.edu/), a computer science research institute at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) campus, where I was lucky to have the joint advice of professors [Karen Livescu](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~klivescu), [Liang Lu](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~llu/) and [Kevin Gimpel](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~kgimpel/). Finally in Summer 2016, I contributed to [Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla)'s Automation Team via [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and [Quarter of Contribution](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution). --></p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not working, I am generally lurking reddit and twitter for keeping myself updated about the recent trends in my research work. I would highly recommend to follow known researchers of your field for getting fast access to latest research directions. I like to collect resources for the benefit of fledgling students under 
<a href="https://move47.github.io/crypto_resources/">Crypto Resources</a> and <a href="https://move47.github.io//Miscellaneous/">Miscellaneous</a> section. The resources may range from basic to advanced level. I also maintain a <a href="https://move47.github.io/archive">blog</a> which sporadically gets updated.</p>

<p>During my undergraduate days, I was associated with <a href="http://www.e-summit-iitbbs.com/">E-Summit</a>, where I both participated and organised several events related to Entrepreneurship. I was also member of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/The-Fourth-WallDramatics-Society-of-IIT-Bhubaneswar-131402333580109">The Fourth Wall</a>(Dramatics Society of IIT Bhubaneswar), where I took part in several open and stage acts. This time, I am and will cherish throughout my life.</p>

<p>I love being called with <em><strong>move47</strong></em>.</p>
