I"æ<p>After a monthâ€™s hard work, we, The Web and Coding Club IIT Bombay, have launched our own wiki website - Grundy! Check it out on <a href="http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki">http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-wiki">What is a Wiki?</h2>

<p>Well we have all seen Wikipedia, but thatâ€™s not the only website in the family of Wikisâ€™. All wikis are powered by a PHP backend, <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">Mediawiki</a>. <a href="http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki">Grundy</a> is another such wiki, and this is why itâ€™s got a strong resemblence to Wikipedia.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-grundy">What is Grundy?</h2>

<p>Grundy is an educational wiki, meant to help beginners get started with programming. Itâ€™s got a large number of tutorials, on various programming topics. All tutorials are hand-tailored by students of IIT Bombay (so far!). However unlike conventional programming tutorials, these take a slightly different approach.</p>

<p>Rather than reinventing the wheel, Grundy aims at bringing together a number of online tutorials and resources along with a set of pre-requisites and motivation to learn a programming skill. We also have exhaustive lists of our community resources, projects and GSoC recommendations.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-i-do-for-grundy">What can I do for Grundy?</h2>

<p>Grundy is contribution driven, and needs your active support to be well maintained and running. Besides using it as a reference, you can help improve it! Hereâ€™s how -</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Request Pages</strong> - On our <a href="http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki">main page</a>, we have a paragraph describing the process to request for new pages. This is the place you should head for if you find something important missing!</li>
  <li><strong>Contribute</strong> - Yes, you can write your own articles! Just head to our <a href="http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki/index.php/Contribution_Guide">Contribution Guide</a> which explains the procedure in detail.</li>
  <li><strong>Publicize</strong> - Grundy is new, and needs contributors. We would be grateful if you can blog about it, reference its articles to others, or maybe share it on public forums!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="building-grundy">Building Grundy</h2>

<p>Itâ€™s been quite a month, and this was the second of the four projects I took up this winter (the first being <a href="/2016/12/22/zero-to-established.html">StackOverflow Contribution</a>, and two more blogs coming up!).<br />
It started off with an idea and a MediaWiki setup by my co-manager on our server. I was at first a bit uncertain about this, but I decided to go ahead and write an article on <a href="http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki/index.php/Programming_101">Programming 101</a>. It was then that I realized how useful this wiki can be to newcomers, who find it so hard to locate the easiest tutorials. It was a great platform to jot down all our knowledge and build some lists of community projects and resources.</p>

<p>Soon we started building it up page by page. First, a few basic articles on general topics like <a href="http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki/index.php/Game_Development">Game Development</a>, <a href="http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki/index.php/Web_Development">Web Development</a> etc. Then a little digression to build up <a href="http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki/index.php/Community_Resources">Community Resources</a>, <a href="http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki/index.php/Community_Projects">Community Projects</a> and <a href="http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki/index.php/GSoC_Projects">GSoC Projects</a>. Finally, a large number of <a href="http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki/index.php/Software_Library_Guides">Software Library Guides</a> and the <a href="http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki/index.php/Contribution_Guide">Contribution Guide</a> mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>It was very important to link the articles to each other well, so that users could easily hop from one article to another. On our <a href="http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki">main page</a>, we have set up the most <em>relevant</em> articles and a table of our top contributors.</p>

<p>My co-manager <a href="https://github.com/cheekujodhpur/">Kumar Ayush</a>, took efforts to set up some wonderful extensions to the wiki, including <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Math">Math</a>, <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SyntaxHighlight">SyntaxHighlight</a>, <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Google_Analytics_Integration">Google Analytics</a>, <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Contribution_Scores">Contribution Scores</a> and <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:MobileFrontend">Mobile Frontend</a>. He and <a href="https://github.com/nihal111">Nihal Singh</a> now working on its <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Category:Search_engine_optimization_extensions">Search Engine Optimization</a>. With these extensions in place, contribution is a joy in itself!</p>

<p>The last and perhaps most important step in <em>Building Grundy</em> has been its contributors. A lot of people, having nothing to do with WnCC directly, have made tremendous contributions to Grundy and we are so grateful (Check out <a href="http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki/index.php/ROS">ROS</a> by the Mars Society, India for instance).<br />
Our team members have also contributed extensively as well, each of them writing articles in their area of interest. Itâ€™s incredible that we received so many articles without a strong apparent incentive - truly, the power of online communities is un-parallel!</p>

<p>Personally, it was fun managing the contributions coming in. I contributed more programming articles towards the beginning, but then took on the role of encouraging others to write articles. Iâ€™m really glad that most people who I requested readily complied and wrote an article in their area of expertise. I now intend to continue the adminâ€™s role and hope to add to Grundy everytime I try out something new!</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">Whatâ€™s Next?</h2>

<p><em>Grundy is far from finished!</em> It has a lot of potential, and we hope to reach a 100 programming articles by next semester. We will be requesting the CSE Department of IIT Bombay (professors and PhD students), to write more CS-oriented articles, with a similar approach. Besides this, we are hoping to get more <em>non-IITB</em> contributors, who can take this endeavour forward.</p>
