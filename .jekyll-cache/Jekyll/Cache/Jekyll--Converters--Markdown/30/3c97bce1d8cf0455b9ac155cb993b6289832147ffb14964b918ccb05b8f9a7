I"Â<p>I took part in <a href="https://hackforchange.io">Hack for Change</a> yesterday at <a href="http://www.thegarage.one/">The Garage</a>, Mumbai with my co-manager <a href="https://github.com/cheekujodhpur/">Kumar Ayush</a>. We were also co-sponsors of the hackathon and brought along our team to help out with the logistics.  It was a great day, and we ended at fourth place (tough luck!). Feels great to take part in a hackathon after 2 years!</p>
