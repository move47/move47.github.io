Hi, I'm Himanshu Goyal. I am a Dual Degree student at [Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar](https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/) in the School of Electrical Sciences, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I work closely with [Prof. Sudipta Saha](https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/profile-print.php?furl=sudipta) on practical and scalability aspects of having Byzantine consensus in low power wireless systems. Along with this, I am also working on security & privacy aspects for large scale decentralised systems. Here, I am focussing on developing privacy-preserving solutions for efficient distributive computation. I am also closely associated with [Decentralized and Smart Systems Research Group (DSSRG)](https://sites.google.com/iitbbs.ac.in/dssrg) at IIT Bhubaneswar.

<!-- I graduated with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in) in 2018. I was a part of the [CSALT](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/csalt/) group and was advised by [Prof. Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/), working on problems in language modeling and sentiment classification. -->

I've spent some excellent summers in industry and academia via internships. In Summer 2020, I interned with Embedded Systems and Robotics group team at TCS Research & Innovation with [Chayan Sarkar](http://www.chayansarkar.com/) on building customized language model for cognitive robotics application.  I also had a short stint working with [Arpita Patra](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arpita/) at [Cryptography and Information Security lab](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~cris/about.html), IISc Bangalore in 2020.In Summer 2019 I worked on workload characterization in Multi-tier Cloud Infrastructure at [CNeRG - Complex Networks Research Lab](https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/), IIT Kharagpur under the mentorship of [Sandip Chakraborty](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sandipc/).
<!-- In Summer 2017, I worked on end-to-end speech recognition at [TTIC](http://ttic.edu/), a computer science research institute at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) campus, where I was lucky to have the joint advice of professors [Karen Livescu](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~klivescu), [Liang Lu](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~llu/) and [Kevin Gimpel](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~kgimpel/). Finally in Summer 2016, I contributed to [Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla)'s Automation Team via [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and [Quarter of Contribution](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution). -->

When I'm not working, I am generally [birding]({ site.url }}/birding), hiking, biking reading or star gazing. I like to [blog]({{ site.url }}/archive.html) and have written a few articles compiling my experiences with graduate school admissions, visa applications, biking etc. During my undergraduate days, I used to lead a club at IIT Bombay, namely [The Web and Coding Club](https://www.facebook.com/wncc.iitb/), where we help people get started with code. I also used to actively contribute to [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/5080995/martianwars) and to our club's [wiki](http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki), a beginner's programming guide. Finally, I [collect]({{ site.url }}/assets/rubik.jpg) Rubiks puzzles! Unfortunately, I am not good at solving them!

Some people on the internet (especially on Mozilla's IRC) know me as *martianwars*.
