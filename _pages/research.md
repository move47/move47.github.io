I am broadly interested in developing algorithms/systems which sufficiently guarantee- Security, Privacy, and Robustness(partial if not wholly). Currently, I am studying underlying principles behind Multi-party Computation(MPC), Homomorphic Encryption(HE), Byzantine Fault Tolerance, Verifiable Secret Sharing, etc. Moreover, I am developing solutions for low-power networks incorporating some of these techniques.
