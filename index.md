My name is __Himanshu Goyal__ ([<span style="color:red">How to pronounce my name</span>](./assets/name.mp3)), and I am a fourth year Dual Degree Student in Computer Science at [Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar](https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/). Currently, I am focussing on to bring trust, security and privacy guarantees in large scale decentralized IoT Systems. I am being advised by [Dr. Sudipta Saha](https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/profile-print.php?furl=sudipt). I am also closely associated with [Decentralized and Smart Systems Research Group (DSSRG)](https://sites.google.com/iitbbs.ac.in/dssrg) at IIT Bhubaneswar.

 In the past, I've spent some excellent summers at [TCS Research and Innovation](https://www.tcs.com/research-and-innovation) (Summer 2020), and  at [CNERG IIT Kharagpur](https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/) (Summer 2019).

I have worked on several disciplines ranging from Deep learning, Systems & Networking, Blockchain, Trustworthy distributed computing and Privacy Preserving Machine Learning(PPML). Well, I enjoy applied cryptography in particular.

I maintain a list of cryptographic resources under the [Resources]({{ site.url }}/crypto_resources) tab. I also [blog]({{ site.url }}/archive) every now and then compiling my personal experiences.

Verily, you can find me reading, lurking reddit and twitter in my spare time. Nevertheless, I am big Cricket fan and love talking about it.
