My name is __Himanshu Goyal__ ([<span style="color:red">How to pronounce my name</span>](./assets/name.mp3)). I am a Dual Degree Student at [Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar](https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/) majoring in Computer Science. Currently, I am focussing to build large scale decentralized IoT/WSNs systems which embodies Trust, Security and Privacy guarantees. I am being advised by [Dr. Sudipta Saha](https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/profile-print.php?furl=sudipt). I am also closely associated with [Decentralized and Smart Systems Research Group (DSSRG)](https://sites.google.com/iitbbs.ac.in/dssrg) at IIT Bhubaneswar.

 <!-- In the past, I've spent some excellent summers at [TCS Research and Innovation](https://www.tcs.com/research-and-innovation) (Summer 2020), and  at [CNERG IIT Kharagpur](https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/) (Summer 2019). -->

I have worked on several disciplines ranging from Deep learning, Systems & Networking, Blockchain, Trustworthy distributed computing and Privacy Preserving Machine Learning(PPML). 

                    Verily, I truly enjoy applied cryptography in particular.

I maintain a list of cryptographic resources under the [Crypto Resources]({{ site.url }}/crypto_resources) tab. It mostly contains references to the courses taught at universities along with some additional useful information. _If you feel to suggest some resources, I welcome you to contact me for the same._ 
I also occasionally [blog]({{ site.url }}/archive) to distill out my understanding from the readings I do. 
Well, you can find me reading, lurking reddit and twitter in my spare time. Nevertheless, I am an ardent Cricket fan and love talking about it.
